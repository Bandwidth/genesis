genesis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bandwidthcom/genesis.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bandwidthcom/genesis)
=========

A Terraform CLI wrapper built by the Bandwidth Incubator.

Goals:
1. Expose a command for each infrastructure-related lifecycle event in an Incubator-style project.
2. Each command should protect against accidental non-automated actions that impact infrastructure.
3. Don't do anything other than wrap the Terraform CLI
